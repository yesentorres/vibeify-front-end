# Vibeify (front-end)

## About the Project
Vibeify is a custom playlist generator. This full stack web application was built with a React front-end, Flask back-end, and was deployed with Heroku. This repo contains all front-end code. The repo for the back-end code can be found [here](https://github.com/yesentorres/vibeify-back-end). 

To see the deployed version, visit [https://vibeify.herokuapp.com/](https://vibeify.herokuapp.com/). Users must have a Spotify account to use the app. 

Vibeify was created by Yesenia Torres ([@yesentorres](https://github.com/yesentorres)) as a capstone project for the [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) (Cohort 13).
